Scheduler
=========

Scheduling solution for SharePoint Parent-Teacher Conferences. Consists of two sets of requirements. Those for parents and those for teachers.

Parent Requirements
-------------------
ES, MS, and HS divisions should allow parents to book appointments with the teachers of their children. Each division differs in several ways:

ES - only Homeroom teachers should be reservable online

MS - Teachers hold "team" conferences where two homeroom teachers hold the conference together. In practice this means that the students in each of their respective homerooms are grouped under one teaching team for the conferences.

HS - Student book reservations for all of their teachers
